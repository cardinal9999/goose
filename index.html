<h1>Goose</h1><cat></cat>
<p>Goose is an online tool for compression. You can compress different types of data.</p><cat></cat><h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>
Goose works by replacing common substrings found in nodes with ASCII control characters.<cat></cat>
Suppose we have this JSON node: <code-block>{"userid": 4545, "icons": ["/img/4545_16.png", "/img/4545_32.png"], "status": null, "deleted": false}</code-block><cat></cat>
It is hard to believe the object is 101 characters long. We can compress this by replacing some common substrings with ASCII characters.
<cat></cat>If we use the Goose compression tool to compress the JSON object, we get this:<cat></cat>
 userid 4545, "icons /img/4545_16.png "/img/4545_32.png, "status , "deleted }. This string is only 88 characters long.
 <cat></cat>If you want to decompress, you can use the decompression tool.
</p>
<h2>Collisions</h2><cat></cat><p>A collision occurs when the decompressor detects an ASCII character that is not a compressed substring.<cat></cat>This can cause
 problems in decompression because the decompressor parses ASCII characters as keywords.<cat></cat> Escape characters are the solution. For node types that do not have escape characters, you can encode them with Base64.<cat></cat>
</p><h2>Why Goose?</h2><cat></cat><p>-> Goose is free, fast, lightweight, and simple.<cat></cat>-> Goose's algorithm
 can compress different types of data, and can even compress scripts.<cat></cat>-> Because Goose uses simple algorithms, it gooses up compression in a variety of programming languages.<cat></cat>
